First prompt in chatGPT:
> I will provide some math equations or expressions, or explain to you what LaTeX output I need. Do not write any explanations or other words, just reply with the LaTex code. My first request is "the text: 'Population std:'. In a new line the equation of population std, in large font."

ChatGPT answer:

> Here is the LaTeX code for your request:
```c
Population std: \\
\Large{\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2}}
```

This is displayed when you put the above code in a $\LaTeX$ interpreter: 

$$
Population std: \\
\Large{\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2}}
$$
